Single-page application for managing **trains**, **RBCs** (Radio Block Centres), and the keyed relations between them. The app is fully client-side; there is no backend — API traffic is intercepted by MSW in the browser and persisted to `localStorage`.

## Disclaimer

This project was developed in part with the assistance of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's AI-powered development CLI. It was used as a sparring partner during the planning phase — evaluating library choices, scaffolding the initial application structure, and authoring portions of the component code.

All architectural and structural decisions were made by the author. Component composition, detail-level styling, and the overall design of the application remained under the author's full direction and ownership.

This codebase should be regarded as a raw MVP. In a production context the following areas would be revisited:

- **Styling** — a more systematic design-system approach with consistent spacing, typography, and thorough responsive behaviour.
- **Data modelling** — richer domain types, stricter validation at system boundaries, and a proper persistence layer.
- **Documentation** — inline code documentation, architectural decision records, and contribution guidelines.
- **Testing** — unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage.
- **Component composition** — further refinement of component boundaries and responsibilities.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # start Vite dev server + MSW worker
pnpm build        # tsc -b && vite build
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm preview      # preview the production build
```

Package manager: **pnpm** (use `pnpm`, not `npm`/`npx`).

## Stack

- **React 19** with the React Compiler enabled (auto-memoisation via `babel-plugin-react-compiler`).
- **TypeScript 5.9**.
- **Vite 8** for dev server and build.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite` — design tokens live in `src/index.css` under an `@theme` block (`db-red`, `db-black`, focus blue).
- **MSW 2** (Mock Service Worker) — all `/api/*` calls are mocked in the browser; seed data is reset via `GET /api/reset`.

## Key libraries

- **React Router v7** — client-side routing.
- **TanStack Query v5** — server-state, caching, and invalidation.
- **TanStack Table + TanStack Virtual** — virtualised tables for large data sets.
- **React Hook Form + Zod + `@hookform/resolvers`** — form state with schema validation.
- **Radix UI + shadcn/ui** — accessible, unstyled primitives under `src/components/ui/`.
- **vaul** — drawer component used by the form drawers.
- **cmdk** — command-palette and combobox primitives used in filter bars.
- **lucide-react** — icons.
- **class-variance-authority**, **clsx**, **tailwind-merge** — composed through the `cn()` helper in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- **lodash-es** — data-handling helpers.

Import alias: `@/` → `src/` (configured in `vite.config.ts`).

## API surface (mocked)

All endpoints are defined in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`. Each handler applies a 200–600 ms artificial delay and persists to `localStorage`.

## Conventions

### Files & exports

- **kebab-case** file names throughout (`train-form-drawer.tsx`, not `TrainFormDrawer.tsx`).
- **Named exports** preferred — `export function Foo()` over `export default`.
- One folder per component: `components/<name>/<name>.tsx`. Small helpers (`utils.ts`) are co-located in the same folder.

### Forms & drawers

- `FormDrawer` (`src/components/form-drawer/form-drawer.tsx`) is the shared shell: it handles open/close, dirty tracking, cancel-with-confirmation, and save/delete actions.
- Concrete forms (`train-form-drawer`, `rbc-form-drawer`, `key-form-drawer`) compose **react-hook-form** + **zod** through `@hookform/resolvers/zod` with the shadcn `Form` primitives.
- Deletion uses a render-prop: `renderRemoveDialog?: (trigger: ReactNode) => ReactNode` — the drawer renders the trigger, the caller supplies the confirmation dialog.
- Shared field layouts come from `src/lib/mixins.ts` (e.g. `formFieldsContainer`).

### Data access

- Thin `fetch` wrappers in `src/api/*.ts`, one file per resource.
- **TanStack Query v5** with array query keys (`["trains"]`, `["relations", { trainId }]`).
- Mutations invalidate affected keys on success; the UI refreshes automatically.
- `useSuspenseQuery` is used where the page shell already awaits data via a router loader.
- Non-ok responses throw; form/drawer errors are surfaced locally.

### Styling

> **Note:** styling in this codebase is deliberately quick-and-dirty — there is no strict design-system abstraction, utility classes are often composed inline, and some spacing/colour choices are pragmatic rather than systematic.

- Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`.
- Design tokens declared in the `@theme` block in `src/index.css` (DB brand colours: `db-red`, `db-black`, focus blue).
- `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` composed through the `cn()` helper in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- UI primitives in `src/components/ui/` (shadcn-style, Radix-based).

## Domain model

Defined in `src/types.ts`:

- **Train** — `{ id, trainType, trainNumber, operator, notes }`
- **RBC** — `{ id, name, location, manufacturer, status, notes }`
- **Relation** — `{ trainId, rbcId, key }` (composite key on `(trainId, rbcId)`)

A relation represents a train being keyed against an RBC. Deleting a train or RBC cascades to remove its relations.

## Pages

- **Trains** (`/zuege`) — virtualised table, filter bar, form drawer for create/edit/delete.
- **RBCs** (`/rbcs`) — same pattern as Trains.
- **Matrix** (`/matrix`) — train × RBC grid showing keyed relations; click-to-edit via the key drawer.
- **Settings** (`/einstellungen`) — data reset + in-app documentation (stack, folder tree, API reference, conventions).
